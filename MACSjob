used MACS2 for the analysis, macs 1.4 was not working as i wanted it to so i just switched to the newest version.

example of arguments used -> macs2 callpeak -t GATA2.uniq.bam -f BAM -g hs -p 1e-8 -m 3 30 -n GATA2

-t -> File 
-f -> Format of the file
-g -> genome size (hs is for the human genome size)
-p -> p-value of 1e-8
-m -> mfold 3,30
-n -> name for files
