used MACS2 for the analysis, macs 1.4 was not working as i wanted it to so i just switched to the newest version.

filterdup (not required but good) - macs2 filterdup -i GATA2v3.sam -f SAM -g hs -p 1e-8 -o <outputFile>
example of arguments used -> macs2 callpeak -t GATA2.uniq.bam -f BAM -g hs -p 1e-8 -m 3 30 -n GATA2

-t -> File 
-f -> Format of the file
-g -> genome size (hs is for the human genome size)
-p -> p-value of 1e-8
-m -> mfold 3,30
-n -> name for files

Produced callpeak Excel sheet explained:

column 1: chromosome 
column 2: start position
column 3: end position
column 4: length of peak region
column 5: absolute peak summit position
column 6: pileup height at peak summit
column 8: fold enrichment for this peak summit against random poisson distribution with local lamdba.

NOTE: unsure of what column 7 & 9 are for.
