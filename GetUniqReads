Okay this command was gotten from -> http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=61908

and the command is -> samtools view -q 10 -b aln.bam > aln.uniq.bam

it seemed to work just fine, my output file is smaller than the original file. the "10" could be increased by some,
it is just a score for quality. Explained below:
- "Keep in mind that "uniqeness" is not a clear cut variable. Rather is a probability that the position of the read is wrong. 
  Specifically, p_wrong= 10^(-mapq/10).So for mapq 10 you have p_wrong= 0.1, for mapq 20 p_wrong= 0.01. 
  In practice I see that most of the reads are either mapq 0 or mapq pretty high (>30) with little in between, 
  so the exact threshold makes little difference. But this depends of course on your study system."
